The meme of Fork The World is to push forward the movement towards decentralized societies.  
Posing a question: Do we really need CEOs, presidents & vice-presidents?  
Nation States & Facebook? Maybe.  
Maybe not ü§∑

The goal of this hackathon isn't for you to hack on our projects for money, the goal of this hackathon is for you to start building your own project & a DAO. As you can see by the agenda, there is almost everything one might need for doing so, from designing a product & a DAO, to choosing a framework & engineering a token.

But we do also offer ways for easy money üôÉ
